# SPRINT VELOCITY & CAPACITY PLANNING

## Estimated Team Capacity per Sprint

### Backend Developer
- **Capacity:** 25-30 points per sprint
- Focus: APIs, database, integrations, business logic

### Flutter Developer
- **Capacity:** 25-30 points per sprint
- Focus: UI implementation, state management, client logic

### Tech Lead
- **Capacity:** 10-15 points per sprint
- Focus: Architecture, code review, technical decisions, complex problem-solving
- Note: Splits time between coding and leadership

### Designer
- **Capacity:** N/A (not story-pointed, work-ahead model)
- Focus: Stay 1-2 sprints ahead of development
- Deliverables: Mockups, prototypes, design system updates

### Project Manager
- **Capacity:** N/A (not story-pointed)
- Focus: Planning, coordination, stakeholder management, unblocking team

## Total Development Capacity per Sprint
**~60-75 story points** (Backend + Flutter + Tech Lead)

## Sprint Point Allocation
- **Sprints 1-8:** 21-29 points (sustainable, building foundation)
- **Sprints 9-14:** 27-35 points (higher complexity, may need prioritization)
- **Sprints 15-16:** All-hands efforts for polish and launch

# RISK MITIGATION

## High-Risk Areas

### 1. Driver-Customer Real-Time Coordination
**Risk:** Complex state synchronization between driver and customer apps
**Mitigation:**
- Extensive testing in Sprint 10-11
- Fallback mechanisms for connectivity issues
- Clear status messaging

### 2. Payment Processing
**Risk:** Security vulnerabilities, failed transactions
**Mitigation:**
- Early Stripe integration testing in Sprint 5
- Security audit before beta
- Comprehensive error handling

### 3. Media Upload (Photos/Videos)
**Risk:** Large file uploads, network issues, storage costs
**Mitigation:**
- Implement compression in Sprint 10
- Progress indicators and retry logic
- Monitor storage costs

### 4. Background Check Integration
**Risk:** Third-party API delays, approval workflow complexity
**Mitigation:**
- Mock integration early in Sprint 8
- Manual override for admins
- Clear status communication to applicants

### 5. Scope Creep
**Risk:** Adding features mid-sprint, delaying launch
**Mitigation:**
- Strict sprint commitments
- Feature parking lot for post-launch
- PM gatekeeping new requests

# NOTES

## Assumptions
- Team is dedicated full-time to this project
- Designer works ahead of development (1-2 sprints)
- No major scope changes during development
- Third-party integrations (Stripe, Checkr, etc.) available and functional
- Backend and Flutter dev work in parallel where possible

## Flexibility
- Story points are estimates and may need adjustment
- High-point sprints (>30) may need story deferral
- Beta feedback may shift priorities for Sprints 17+
- Some stories may be combined or split based on complexity

## Dependencies
- Firebase/backend infrastructure must be ready by Sprint 1
- Design system must be complete before Sprint 1
- Payment integration must work before Sprint 5
- Driver app depends on customer order creation (Sprint 5)
